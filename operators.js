// Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

// JavaScript Arithmetic
let x = 10;
let y = 20;

// addition
let add = x +y;
// subtraction
let sub = x-y;
// multiplication
let mul = x*y;
// exponentation
let exp = x**y;
// division
let div = x/y;
// modulus(remainder);
let mod = x%y;

// The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
// The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

// Js Assingment Operators.


let x2 = 1;

x2 += y2;
// same as x2 = x2 + y2;
x2 -= y2;
x2 *= y2;
x2 /= y2;
x2 %= y2;

// JavaScript Comparison Operators

x2 == y2;  // equal to
x2 === y2; // qual to and equal type
x2 != y2;
x2 !== y2;
x2 > y2; // greater than.
x2 < y2; // less than.
x2 >= y2; // greater than or equal to.
x2 <= y2; // less than or equla to

// Javascript Logical Operators.

// &&
(x2 == 1 && y2 > 1)
// ||
(x2 == 1 || y2 > 1)
// ! 
!(x2 == 1)
